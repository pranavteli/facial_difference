# Facial Landmark and Expression Changes Detection

This Python script uses the dlib library along with OpenCV to detect facial landmarks and highlight changes in specific facial features, such as the eyes and lips, between two images. It can also display all 68 facial landmarks on a single image.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python dlib
  
## Download the pre-trained facial landmark predictor file from dlib's website and replace shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat in the code with the actual path.
(http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)

## Customization
Adjust facial landmark coordinates based on specific requirements.
Change the image paths, resize dimensions, or any other parameters to fit your needs.
